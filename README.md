# Thoughts
Markdown thoughts managed with Obsidian.

This repo is scraped using GitHubs GraphQL api, and the contents are processed with grey-matter for display in my digital garden. 

Thoughts grew out of a desire to "deplatform" myself more and more. My Facebook account was deleted long ago, but Twitter and IG remain. While I like sharing content there, I've never loved the lack of control over my content. Getting into web3 exacerbated that. 

While pondering decentralization and micro-content I came to realize few things are as decentralized as a personal website that you control (sorry providers like Cargo and Squarespace). If you own your code and can host where you want then your content is actually yours. 

So yeah. That is what Thoughts grew out of. Being Markdown, and repo based, it can go anywhere. It can get its own site, it can be expanded, it can feature additional content, etc. 

Thoughts are published currently on my personal site, iammatthias.com
